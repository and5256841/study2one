In 1988, when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched, polio was endemic in 125 countries and paralyzed more than 350,000 children annually. By 2024, that number had dropped by over 99%, with only a handful of cases reported worldwide.\n\nThe success has been driven largely by massive vaccination campaigns, particularly in developing countries. Health workers travel to remote villages and conflict zones to administer the oral polio vaccine, often going door to door. However, the final stages of eradication have proven the most difficult. The remaining cases are concentrated in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where ongoing conflict, population displacement, and vaccine misinformation continue to pose challenges.\n\nPublic health officials remain optimistic but caution that surveillance and vaccination efforts must continue until the disease is fully eliminated.

A growing body of research has revealed that a significant proportion of healthcare workers (HCWs) themselves express doubts about certain vaccines, most notably seasonal influenza and, more recently, COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nA 2023 meta-analysis of 85 studies from 35 countries found that approximately 23% of healthcare workers reported hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination. The rates varied considerably by profession: nurses tended to show higher hesitancy rates (28%) compared to physicians (12%). Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among HCWs included concerns about side effects, distrust of the rapid development process, religious or philosophical beliefs, and exposure to misinformation on social media.\n\nThe implications are profound. Healthcare workers are not only at higher risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases but also serve as trusted sources of health information for their patients. When a nurse or doctor expresses doubt about a vaccine, it can significantly influence patients' decisions. Studies have consistently shown that a healthcare provider's personal vaccination status is one of the strongest predictors of whether they will recommend vaccination to their patients.\n\nInterventions that have shown promise include providing transparent, evidence-based information about vaccine development and safety, offering vaccines conveniently at the workplace, engaging trusted peer leaders as vaccine champions, and addressing specific concerns through open dialogue rather than mandates.

However, a substantial and growing body of evidence now demonstrates that air pollution is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.\n\nFine particulate matter (PM2.5) \u2014 particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \u2014 is considered the most harmful component of air pollution for cardiovascular health. These microscopic particles penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, triggering systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Long-term exposure to elevated PM2.5 levels has been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in arterial walls that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that outdoor air pollution contributes to approximately 4.2 million premature deaths globally each year, with cardiovascular disease accounting for the largest share \u2014 roughly 40% of these deaths. Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden, as they tend to have higher pollution levels and weaker regulatory frameworks.\n\nRecent research has highlighted that even short-term spikes in air pollution can trigger acute cardiovascular events in vulnerable individuals, including the elderly, people with pre-existing heart conditions, and those with diabetes. Studies in major cities have documented increases in hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes on days with high pollution levels.\n\nPublic health strategies to mitigate cardiovascular harm from air pollution include strengthening air quality standards, transitioning to clean energy sources, promoting urban green spaces, and advising high-risk individuals to limit outdoor activity during high-pollution days. At the clinical level, physicians are increasingly encouraged to consider air pollution exposure as part of cardiovascular risk assessment.\n\n(Original content \u2014 Study2One)",

Digital health literacy, defined as the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to address or solve a health problem, is now essential for effective healthcare navigation.\n\nA cross-sectional study conducted in 12 European countries in 2024 found that only 38% of adults over 65 felt confident using digital health tools, compared to 82% of adults aged 25-44. The study identified several barriers: limited experience with technology, physical challenges such as poor eyesight and reduced fine motor skills, cognitive difficulties in navigating complex interfaces, fear of making errors with personal health data, and a preference for face-to-face communication with healthcare providers.\n\nThe consequences of low digital health literacy are not trivial. Elderly patients who cannot access patient portals may miss important test results, medication reminders, or appointment notifications. Those unable to use telemedicine platforms may face longer wait times for in-person visits or forgo care altogether. In essence, the digital transformation of healthcare risks widening existing health inequities along generational lines.\n\nPromising interventions include designing age-friendly digital interfaces with larger text, simpler navigation, and voice-command options; providing free digital literacy workshops at community centers and libraries; training family members and caregivers to serve as digital health navigators; and maintaining non-digital alternatives for essential healthcare services.

Without effective antimicrobials, routine medical procedures such as surgeries, organ transplants, and cancer chemotherapy become significantly more dangerous, as the risk of untreatable infections rises sharply.\n\nTraditionally, AMR was viewed primarily as a human health problem linked to overuse of antibiotics in clinical settings. However, the One Health approach recognizes that human, animal, and environmental health are interconnected. Approximately 73% of all antimicrobials sold globally are used in livestock production \u2014 not to treat sick animals, but as growth promoters and prophylactics. Resistant bacteria can transfer between animals and humans through direct contact, the food chain, and shared water sources. Similarly, pharmaceutical manufacturing waste and agricultural runoff contaminate waterways, creating environmental reservoirs of resistant organisms.\n\nThe One Health response to AMR requires coordinated action across multiple sectors. In human health, this means improving diagnostic capabilities to ensure antibiotics are prescribed only when truly needed, strengthening infection prevention and control, and investing in the development of new antimicrobials and alternative therapies. In animal health, it involves phasing out the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters, implementing stricter veterinary oversight of antibiotic use, and improving animal husbandry practices to reduce the need for prophylactic treatments. Environmentally, it demands better regulation of pharmaceutical waste, improved wastewater treatment systems, and monitoring of resistant organisms in ecosystems.\n\nCritics of the One Health approach argue that its broad, multi-sectoral nature makes implementation slow and coordination difficult, particularly in low-resource settings where regulatory capacity is limited. Proponents counter that the interconnected nature of AMR makes a siloed approach \u2014 focusing on human health alone \u2014 fundamentally inadequate. As resistant infections claim an estimated 1.27 million lives annually and could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050, the urgency of a comprehensive response cannot be overstated.\n\n(Original content \u2014 Study2One)",

Enshrined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as Target 3.8, UHC encompasses the full spectrum of health services, from prevention and promotion to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.\n\nProgress toward UHC has been uneven. The WHO's UHC Service Coverage Index, which measures access to essential health services on a scale from 0 to 100, showed a global average of 68 in 2021, up from 45 in 2000. However, significant disparities persist. High-income countries average scores above 80, while many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia score below 40. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to essential health services, reversing years of progress in some regions.\n\nFinancial protection remains one of the most challenging dimensions of UHC. Globally, approximately 2 billion people face catastrophic or impoverishing health spending, meaning they must spend more than 10% of their household budget on healthcare or are pushed below the poverty line by medical expenses. Out-of-pocket payments continue to be the primary source of health financing in many developing countries, creating a system where the quality of care a person receives depends largely on their ability to pay.\n\nInnovative financing mechanisms are being explored to close the UHC gap. These include expanding tax-funded public health systems, implementing social health insurance schemes, leveraging digital technology to reduce administrative costs, and increasing international development assistance for health. Some countries have made remarkable strides: Thailand achieved near-universal coverage through its Universal Coverage Scheme, which provides comprehensive services to all citizens for a nominal copayment of roughly one US dollar per visit. Rwanda expanded community-based health insurance to cover over 90% of its population through the Mutuelles de Sant\u00e9 program.\n\nCritics caution that achieving UHC is not simply a matter of financing. Workforce shortages, infrastructure gaps, governance challenges, and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases all threaten to undermine coverage expansion. The WHO estimates a projected shortfall of 10 million health workers globally by 2030, concentrated in the countries that can least afford it.\n\n(Original content \u2014 Study2One)",
